# Module 2 Project: 3D Printing Sculpture

For this project, you will create a 3D printed sculpture of a recursive system, such as a fractal or L-system. Your sculpture should be a minimum of 15cm in its largest dimension, and should incorporate at least one element of recursion.

In addition to your final 3D printed object, you will also be required to submit any intermediate files (such as your L-system rule set and any programmatic design files) and a brief explanation of your design process.

Your sculpture should be fabricated using a 3D printer. You may use any software you wish to create your design, but you must write the program that generates the final STL file for 3D printing.

The theme of your sculpture is up to you, but you should aim to create a visually interesting and aesthetically pleasing object. Consider the material properties of the 3D printing medium you are using, and how you can use them to create an engaging final product.

### Deliverables:
- A 3D printed sculpture
- The STL file used for 3D printing
- All intermediate files and programs used to create the final STL file
