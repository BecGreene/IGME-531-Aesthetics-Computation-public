In this series of assignments, you will be building your own library for drawing with SVG. This assignment extends your work in "Recode _Sainte-Victoire en Rouge_", "Recode _(Des)Ordres_", and "Recode _Schotter_", asking you to now implement programatic randomness and noise functions.

Your goal in this assignment is to write a program that generates an SVG file. This file should (to some reasonable degree) replicate [Interruptions](https://dam.org/museum/artists_ui/artists/molnar-vera/interruptions/) (1968-1969) by [Vera Molnar](https://dam.org/museum/artists_ui/artists/molnar-vera/).

To do this, you will need to implement reusable program components that can introduce randomness to some degree using one of the following methods:
- Random number generation
- Perlin noise
- Worley noise

Using your new randomness code, draw _Interruptions_ as an SVG file. Then, make one or more creative variations on _Interruptions_, experimenting with different levels of randomness or elements.

## Learning Goals
- Practice manipulating and transforming visual components.
- Practice writing reusable code components
- Expand and refactor your own library to incorporate composite components

## Deliverables
- An SVG file that replicates _Interruptions_.
- One or more SVG files that are variations on _Interruptions_.
- The program that generated the SVG files, containing your library (which should now be primitive components, path, polyline, group, transforms, and randomness).
- A README.md file that briefly explains how to run your program, where to find your new components, and any important design decisions you made.

## Grading Criteria

> _So long as you attend the critique, work may be redone and resubmitted for a higher grade._
