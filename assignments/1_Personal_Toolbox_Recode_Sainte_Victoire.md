# Personal Toolbox - Recode _Sainte-Victoire en Rouge_

In this series of assignments, you will be building your own library for drawing with SVG. This first assignment focuses on implementing software components for drawing primitive shapes and basic lines.

Your goal in this assignment is to write a program that generates an SVG file. This file should (to some reasonable degree) replicate [_Sainte-Victoire en Rouge_](https://www.zigzags.be/blog/2023/1/26/vra-molnar) by Vera MolnÃ¡r.

To do this, you will need to implement reusable program components that can represent each of these SVG primitives:
- Circles
- Ellipses
- Rectangles
- Polygons
- Lines

Use these primitive components to draw _Sainte-Victoire_ as an SVG file. Then, notice that _Sainte-Victoire_ is just a bunch of squares; use your rect component to replicate the original, then use your other conponents to create one or more variations on the original. 

## Learning Goals
- Understand the structure and syntax of SVG files
- Practice writing reusable code components
- Begin work on your own library, which you'll use in Project 1.

## Deliverables
- An SVG file that replicates _Sainte-Victoire_.
- One or more SVG files that are variations on _Sainte-Victoire_.
- The program that generated the SVG files, containing your primitive components.
    - For each primitive component, it should be possible to specify attributes such as position, size, color, radius, etc.
    - These components should be located together, and be reasonably self-contained and portable.
    - You should not have copy-pasted your program for each variation; there should be (more or less) one program that generates all of the SVG files.
- A README.md file that briefly explains how to run your program, where to find your primitive components, and any important design decisions you made.

## Grading Criteria

> _So long as you attend the critique, work may be redone and resubmitted for a higher grade._
