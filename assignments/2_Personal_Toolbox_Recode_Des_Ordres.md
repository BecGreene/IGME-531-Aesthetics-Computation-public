# Personal Toolbox - Recode _(Des)Ordres_

<img src="assets/des_ordres.webp" width="100%" height="150px" style="object-fit: cover" >

In this series of assignments, you will be building your own library for drawing with SVG. This assignment extends your work on representing primitive components in "Recode _Sainte-Victoire en Rouge_", asking you to now implement representations of paths, polylines, and groups.

Your goal in this assignment is to write a program that generates an SVG file. This file should (to some reasonable degree) replicate [(Des)Ordres](https://dam.org/museum/artists_ui/artists/molnar-vera/des-ordres/) (1974) by [Vera MolnÃ¡r](https://www.moma.org/artists/37083).

To do this, you will need to implement reusable program components that can represent each of these SVG elements:
- Polylines
- Paths
- Groups

Use your new `group` component, as well as your previous primitive components, to draw _(Des)Ordres_ as an SVG file. Then, use your new `polyline` and `path` components to create one or more creative variations on the original. 

## Learning Goals
- Practice designing and using tile-like objects in SVG
- Practice writing reusable code components
- Expand and refactor your own library to incorporate composite components

## Deliverables
- An SVG file that replicates _(Des)Ordres_.
- One or more SVG files that are variations on _(Des)Ordres_.
- The program that generated the SVG files, containing your library (which should now be primitive components + path, polyline, and group).
- A README.md file that briefly explains how to run your program, where to find your primitive components, and any important design decisions you made.

> _All of the above should be committed to a GitHub repository; submit the URL of this repository._

## Grading Criteria

> _So long as you attend the critique, work may be redone and resubmitted for a higher grade._
